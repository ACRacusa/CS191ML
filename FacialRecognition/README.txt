Facial Recognition of Labeled Faces in the Wild using Support Vector Machine and Principal Component Analysis
by Aldrin C. Racusa and Lorenz Timothy Barco Ranera


ABOUT THE DIFFERENT FILES

1. lfw_preprocessed.tar.gz
	-this is the dataset of the study.

2. pca-svm-exer.py
	-this program performs PCA and train the model using SVM
	-this will also output the graph of the cumulative explained variance of the PC
	-this will output the accuracy, precision, and recall of the SVM model
	-the graph of the cumulative explained variance of the PCA should be CLOSED first in order to
	view the new dataset with three principal components and the accuracy of the SVM model

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT
